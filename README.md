# InventoryTracker
Welcome to InventoryTracker!
You don't need to worry about how to deploy it because I have done that part for you!
Access the working site at: https://teshinventorytracker.herokuapp.com/login

If you are curious how to deploy it though, its very simple:
Make sure you have python, pip, setuptools and wheel installed
Then install SQLite3 and the requirements from my requirements file with pip
After all of that is done, you should be able to run the site with a simple "flask run" command and it will create a local server where you would be able to run everything just like the link above.
